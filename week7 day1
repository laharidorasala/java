Dr. Max has conducted the academic task in his class with 5 Multiple Choice Questions each having 4 options A/B/C/D. He wanted to write a program which can evaluate the test papers of all the N students such that each correct answer is awarded 1 mark and for incorrect answer penalty is 0.25 marks.
The program must read the number of students N and the the answers of all the N students in the form of a String. If any question is not attempted by any student, then X should be given as input corresponding to that question e.g. ABAXD
It is expected that the marks of all the N students are displayed separated by SPACE.
Input Format
First Line of the input reads the String of CORRECT ANSWERS
Second Line of the input reads the number of students N
Next N lines read the answer Strings of the N students respectively.
Constraints
N > 0
Input characters can be either in Upper Case or Lower Case
Else "Incorrect Input"
Output Format
Print the marks of all the N students separated by SPACE



import java.util.Scanner;

public class EvaluateTestPapers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the correct answers
        String correctAnswers = scanner.nextLine().toUpperCase();

        // Read the number of students
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // consume the newline character

        // Evaluate the test papers of all the N students
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String answers = scanner.nextLine().toUpperCase();
            if (answers.length() != correctAnswers.length()) {
                System.out.println("Incorrect Input");
                return;
            }

            double marks = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < answers.length(); j++) {
                char answer = answers.charAt(j);
                if (answer == 'X') {
                    continue; // question not attempted, no marks added or deducted
                }
                char correctAnswer = correctAnswers.charAt(j);
                if (answer == correctAnswer) {
                    marks += 1;
                } else {
                    marks -= 0.25;
                }
            }
            System.out.print(marks + " ");
        }
    }
}




Chacha Chaudhary has asked Sheena to find out the Nth occurence of any Word in the Paragraph. Sheena finds it a tedious task to find Nth occurence so she wants you to write a small java program which can solve her problem and she will give you a gift for helping her. Let us write a code.
Input Format
First line reads the paragraph contents
Second line reads the word to be found and N separated by Space
Constraints
N>0 Else "Incorrect Input"
Output Format
Prints the starting index of the Nth occurence of the word in the paragraph
Prints Not Present if not occuring even a single time and prints the last occurence if occuring less than N times.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class WordOccurrence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner st = new Scanner(System.in);
        String paragraph = st.nextLine().toLowerCase();
        String word = st.next().toLowerCase();
        int n = st.nextInt();

        if (n <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Incorrect Input");
            return;
        }
        int count = 0;
        int index = -1;
        int lastOccurrenceIndex = -1;

        while (true) {
            index = paragraph.indexOf(word, index + 1);
            if (index == -1) {
                break; 
            }
            count++;
            if (count == n) {
                System.out.println(index);
                return;
            }
            lastOccurrenceIndex = index;
        }
        if (count == 0) {
            System.out.println("Not Present");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println(lastOccurrenceIndex);
    }
}
