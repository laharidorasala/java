import java.util.Scanner;

public class PasswordManager {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        String password = scanner.nextLine();

    }
}


Puneet and Virat are playing a game. Virat tells a number that Puneet need to check whether that number is even and multiple of 13 or not. Write a program in which implement a method public boolean check(int n) which will return true if number satisfy the conditions else return false.
Input Format
One integer value representing number given by Virat.
Constraints
Number will lie between 10 and 500.
Output Format
True/False according to the value returned by the method or will print Invalid Input in case of number did not match the constraints.

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n =sc.nextInt();
        boolean result = check(n);
        if (result == true) {
            System.out.println("True");
        } else if (result == false) {
            System.out.println("False");
        }
    }
    
    public static boolean check(int n) {
        if (n < 10 && n > 500) {
            System.out.println("Invalid Input");
            return false;
        } else if (n % 2 == 0 && n % 13 == 0) {
            return true ;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
